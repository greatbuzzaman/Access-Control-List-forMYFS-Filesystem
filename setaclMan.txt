DESCRIPTION
        Sets  an  existing file's access control list (ACL) . Pathname points to a path name of a file.It
        take a pathname, a numeric type, a numeric id number, and a numeric permissions flag
        ( bit 2 for read,bit 1 for write, bit 0 for execute). The type is be 0 if the numeric id number is a user-id,
        while it is  1 if the numeric id number is a group-id. If the id number
        passed in to this system call is zero then the id number of the
        currently running process is used ( this gives you id number zero as a way to indicate unset fields
        of the ACL list you associate with each file).


        Access Control Lists
        An ACL consists of a series of entries.Entries can be categorized  in

        Entries  can  appear  in any order.  The system orders them as needed for access checking.
        In  addition,  up  to 16optional ACL entries can be set to restrict or grant access to a file.

        Altering a base ACL entry's modes with changes the file's corresponding
        permission bits.  The permission bits can be altered also by using (see
        chmod(2)) and read using (see stat(2)).

RETURN VALUE
        Return the following values:

        ON Successful completion,returns'0' and  an appropriate message to console.

        ON Failure,returns error and  the appropriate error messageto the console.



ERRORS
        EPERM- Operation not permitted, does not have owner or root rights
        EACCESS- Access denied for particualr action .

DEPENDENCIES
